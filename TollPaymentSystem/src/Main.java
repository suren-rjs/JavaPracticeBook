/**
The application was TOLL PAYMENT PROCESSING .
They insisted us to do it in a object-oriented language. First they asked the design( what are all the classes and objects & what data structure do you use).
Application description:
•
•	There are ‘n’ number of points in a highway out of which some points collect toll.
•	Each toll has its own charging scheme according to the vehicles and whether they
are a VIP user.
•	If they are VIP user, 20% discount apply.
•	If the vehicle passes 3 tollgates, it has to pay in all the 3 tollgates according to the
scheme of respective tolls.
There were 4 modules.
1. Given the details of vehicle type, start and destination……display the total toll paid during
the journey and print the amount after applying the discount.


2. Display the details of all the tolls…..like what are all the vehicles(vehicle number) passed
that respective toll and the amount each vehicle paid……and the total amount charged in
that toll.
3. Display the details of all the vehicles …….like what are all the journeys did it take….the
start and destination of the same……tolls it passed during that journey….amount paid in
that journey…..and the total amount paid by that vehicle.
4. Assume the highway as a circular path……we have to find the short route and identify
the tolls between that route and calculate the amount.
